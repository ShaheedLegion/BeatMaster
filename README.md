# BeatMaster
Little game using software rasterization.

BeatMaster is a tiny game that's in development which uses software rasterization and some other techniques to create
a fast-paced top-down shooter.

The game is really not playable at the moment, but aims to be within the next few days.

I still haven't decided on sound support, so it's best guess at this point, but will probably go with something tiny like
mini fmod.
